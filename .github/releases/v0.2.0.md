# Enhancements

- The x-display-name OpenAPI field is now used to determine property names, if present.
- The command parser now consumes the parameters endpoint instead of parser restrictions, as the parser restrictions endpoint will be removed soon.
- Arguments and Options are now both treated as parameters, and are sent to the Commands API as additional properties on ExecuteCommandRequest objects.
- Responses to GetCommandParameters calls are now cached for an hour, or until the cache's size exceeds the threshold.
- Source System and Source System ID are now passed as headers to the commands service.  These have been added as client request options.
- New method: IBrighidCommandsCache.ClearAllParameters added for clearing all cached parameters.
- New Method: IBrighidCommandsCache.ParametersExist added for checking if a command's parameters have been cached.
- Updated Brighid.Identity.Client to v0.5.0

## Breaking Changes

- IBrighidCommandsCache.GetOrCreateAsync has been renamed to IBrighidCommandsCache.GetOrCreateParametersAsync
