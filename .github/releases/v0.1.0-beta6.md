- Converts the parse command facade into a larger facade for both parsing and executing a command.
- Adds IServiceCollection.ConfigureBrighidCommands service collection extension method for configuring a default prefix (plus other things in the future).
- Swagger is now downloaded using MSBuild and committed to source control.  Downloading directly from the API was leading to slow builds, and we want to be able to generate the client from dev swagger in the future.
- Various 3rd party dependency updates.
